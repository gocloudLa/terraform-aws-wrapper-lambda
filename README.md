## üöÄ Quick Start
```hcl
lambda_parameters = {
  "ExSimple" = {
    # create = false

    description             = "Simple example of functon"
    handler                 = "index.lambda_handler"
    runtime                 = "python3.9"
    create_package          = false
    ignore_source_code_hash = true
    ## If only attach_vpc is enabled, it uses the default values from datasources
    attach_vpc = true
    ## Filter by VPC name modifying datasources
    #vpc_name = "dmc-prd"
    #subnet_name = "dmc-prd-public*"
    #security_group = "dmc-prd-default"
    ## Using IDs as variables
    #vpc_subnet_ids = ["subnet-0816f01da43f4f564"]
    #vpc_security_group_ids  = ["sg-0281b2c2fff506cea"]
    memory_size              = 256
    timeout                  = 10
    attach_policy_statements = true
    policy_statements = {
      s3 = {
        effect    = "Allow",
        actions   = ["s3:List*"]
        resources = ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
      }
    }
    environment_variables = {}
  }
}
```


## üîß Additional Features Usage

### Zip deployment
Deploy a lambda function with a zip file. This avoids having to version the source code of the function in Terraform.<br/>
To activate this feature, the following variables must be configured


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
create_package          = false
  ignore_source_code_hash = true
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - Load Balancer
Deploy a lambda function that has an Application Load Balancer as a trigger. This functionality will automatically create the Target Group and the resources and link them as a trigger for the lambda function.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-01" = {
    trigger_type  = "alb"
    alb_name      = "dmc-prd-core-external-00"
    listener_port = 443
    # lambda_multi_value_headers_enabled = false # Default: false
    listener_rules = {
      "redirect" = {
        priority = 100
        actions = [{
          type        = "redirect"
          host        = "google.com"
          port        = 443
          status_code = "HTTP_301"
        }]
        conditions = [{
          host_headers = ["redirect.${local.zone_public}"]
        }]
      }
      "forward" = {
        #actions = [{
        #  type = "forward"
        #}]
        conditions = [{
          host_headers = ["ExBalancer.${local.zone_public}"]
        }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - EventBridge
Deploy a lambda function that has an EventBridge as a trigger. This functionality will automatically create the Cloudwatch rule and the target of the same; and link them as a trigger for the lambda function.<br/>
A cron job or an event pattern logic can be used as a rule.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-01" = {
    trigger_type = "eventbridge"
    schedule     = "cron(0 0 ? * * 0)"
  }
}
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - SNS
Deploy a lambda function that has an SNS as a trigger. This functionality will automatically create the subscription of the lambda function to the SNS topic to use it as a trigger.<br/>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** It is required that the SNS topic is deployed beforehand.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-01" = {
    trigger_type  = "sns"
    sns_topic_arn = data.aws_sns_topic.base-alerts.arn
  }
}
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - S3
Deploy a lambda function that is triggered by an S3 bucket event. This functionality will create an S3 notification resource, which will allow defining the type of event, directory, and object type that will invoke the lambda function.<br/>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** It is required that the S3 bucket is deployed beforehand.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-02" = {
    trigger_type  = "s3_notification"
    bucket_name   = "lambda-notification-${local.common_name}"
    events        = ["s3:ObjectCreated:Put"]
    filter_prefix = "prefix/"
    filter_suffix = ".json"
  }
}
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - HTTP APIGateway
Deploy a lambda function that has an HTTP APIGateway endpoint as a trigger. This functionality will automatically create the necessary resources to register a path/route in APIGateway and link it through an integration with the Lambda function.<br/>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** It is required that the APIGateway on which the endpoint will be created is deployed beforehand.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-apiv2-get" = {
    trigger_type  = "apigateway"
    api_id = module.api_gateway.apigatewayv2_api_id
    integration_type = "AWS_PROXY"
    connection_type           = "INTERNET"
    #content_handling_strategy = "CONVERT_TO_TEXT"
    description               = "Lambda example"
    integration_method        = "ANY"
    #integration_uri           = aws_lambda_function.example.invoke_arn
    #passthrough_behavior      = "WHEN_NO_MATCH"
    payload_format_version = "2.0"
    timeout_milliseconds   = 12000
    route_key = "ANY /example/{proxy+}"
  }
}
```


</details>


### Simplification of triggers - SQS and DynamoDB
Deploy a lambda function that has DynamoDB or SQS as Trigger and Event Mappings. This functionality allows you to avoid having to separately declare the logic of the triggers and event mappings with which we will link the lambda function to these services.<br/>
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** It is required that the SQS queue or the DynamoDB table stream be deployed beforehand.


<details><summary>Configuration Code</summary>

```hcl
triggers = {
  "trigger-05" = {
    trigger_type            = "sqs"
    source_arn              = aws_sqs_queue.example.arn
    function_response_types = ["ReportBatchItemFailures"]
    scaling_config = {
      maximum_concurrency = 20
    }
  }
  "trigger-06" = {
    trigger_type      = "dynamodb"
    source_arn        = aws_dynamodb_table.example.stream_arn
    starting_position = "LATEST"
  }
}
```
